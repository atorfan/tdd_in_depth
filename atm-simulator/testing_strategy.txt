Testing Strategy

 Unit Tests
====================
The happy path (account number and PIN valid) making a withdrawal
The happy path (account number and PIN valid) making a fund transfer
Account number not valid (because that logic is under screens module)
PIN not valid (because that logic is under screens module)

 Acceptance Tests
====================
I would choose AtmSimulator as a Subject Under Test testing "user journey" from entering the account number and PIN to
the withdrawal operation

 Integration Tests
====================
CliPrompt with real collaborators (an InputStream and the ConsolePrinter)
